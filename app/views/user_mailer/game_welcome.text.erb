You've just joined the game, <%= @game.name %>!
===============================================
 
Thank you for joining the game! Get excited to start.

Please don't forget your kill code: <%= @user.kill_code %>!
Keep it secret, and, if you get killed provide it to your assassin
so they can confirm the kill. 

Also, remember, the game begins at <%= @game.game_start%>.
So have your weapon and bunker ready.

Thanks for for joining a game and Good Luck!
