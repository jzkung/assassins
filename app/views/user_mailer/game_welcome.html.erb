    <h1>You've just joined the game: <%= @game.name %>!</h1>
    <p>
      Thank you for joining the game! Get excited to start.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Please don't forget your kill code: <%= @user.kill_code %>!
      Keep it secret, and, if you get killed provide it to your assassin
      so they can confirm the kill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, remember, the game begins at <%= @game.game_start%>.
      So have your weapon and bunker ready.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for for joining a game and Good Luck!</p>
